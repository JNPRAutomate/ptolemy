### Web UI Usage

In Web UI, you can start with building a configuration consisting of all the parameters which will be needed to run the application successfully. The configuration has two flavors, one with global configuration by which, you can connect to all the devices using one set of credential (i.e., username and password) or entering them separately for every device.
